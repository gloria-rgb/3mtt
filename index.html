        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p><img src="images/review_2.jpg" alt="a picture" srcset=""></p>
        <p> My name is Gloria, and I’m proudly from Anambra State, Nigeria. I’m currently on an exciting journey into the world of software engineering, where I’m learning how to build solutions that can make a real difference. Technology has always fascinated me—how a few lines of code can solve big problems and create things people use every day.
<br>
            As I grow in this field, I’m focusing on building strong foundations in programming, web development, and software design. I’m passionate about using tech to improve lives, especially within my community, and I’m inspired by the power of innovation to drive positive change.
            <br>
            My goal is not just to become a skilled software engineer but also to inspire more young people—especially women—from Nigeria and Africa at large to explore tech careers. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and the impact of determination.
            <br>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, learning new skills, and connecting with others who share similar goals.
